# Privacy Policy for YouChoose

**Effective Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025

## Our Privacy Commitment

YouChoose is designed with privacy at its core. This app was created to help parents offer quick, simple choices for their special needs children. We understand that communication is deeply personal, and we are committed to protecting your family's privacy.
 
**Our fundamental principle: Your data stays on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or sell any of your information.**

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

YouChoose stores the following information locally on your iPhone or iPad. This data never leaves your device:

#### 1. Choice Boards and Choices
- Board names you create
- Choice text and titles
- Colors you select for choices
- SF Symbols (icons) you choose
- Photos you add to choices (from your photo library or camera)
- Organization and order of your boards

#### 2. Optional Usage Analytics
**Default Setting: OFF** - Analytics are disabled by default to protect your privacy.

If you choose to enable analytics in Settings, the app may collect the following information locally on your device:
- Which boards you use most frequently
- How many times choices are selected
- Response times (how quickly choices are made)
- When and how long the app is used (session data)
- Board sizes and names (for insights only)

**Important: Even when enabled, all analytics data:**
- Stays on your device only
- Is automatically deleted after 30 days (customizable)
- Can be completely deleted by you at any time in Settings
- Is never transmitted to us or any third party
- Contains no personal content from your communication

#### 3. App Preferences
- Settings you configure (speech volume, haptic feedback, etc.)
- Appearance preferences (light/dark mode, color schemes)
- Accessibility settings you enable

### Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be clear about what we do not collect:
- ❌ We do not collect any personal information
- ❌ We do not collect the content of your communications
- ❌ We do not record what you or your child say using the app
- ❌ We do not track your location
- ❌ We do not use analytics services (like Google Analytics)
- ❌ We do not use advertising networks
- ❌ We do not require accounts or login
- ❌ We do not transmit any data to our servers or cloud services

## How We Use Information

All information collected by YouChoose is used solely on your device to:
- Save your choice boards and preferences
- Provide optional usage insights if you enable analytics
- Sync data between the app and widget (stored in a secure app group on your device)
- Improve your experience with the app

**We never use your information for advertising, marketing, or any purpose beyond the core functionality of the app.**

## Photo Library and Camera Access

YouChoose requests permission to access your photo library and camera only if you choose to add photos to your choice buttons. 

**How we use photos:**
- Photos are stored locally on your device as part of your choice boards
- Photos are never uploaded to our servers or any cloud service
- You can remove photos from the app at any time
- If you delete a choice board, associated photos are deleted from the app

**You can deny photo access** and still use all other features of YouChoose. The app will work fully with SF Symbols (icons) instead of photos.

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
All data is stored securely on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework and encrypted iOS storage. Your data is protected by your device's security features, including:
- Device passcode/Face ID/Touch ID
- iOS encryption
- Secure storage containers

### App Group Storage
YouChoose uses an app group (`group.com.gapps.YouChoose`) to share data between the main app and the home screen widget. This is a standard iOS security feature that keeps your data isolated from other apps while allowing the widget to display your quick choices.

### No Cloud Storage
YouChoose does not sync data to iCloud or any other cloud service. Your data exists only on your device. This means:
- ✅ Complete privacy - no data transmitted anywhere
- ⚠️ If you delete the app or reset your device, your data will be lost
- ⚠️ Backup your device regularly using iTunes or iCloud backup to preserve your data

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

**We do not share your data with anyone.** Period.

YouChoose does not:
- Share data with third-party analytics services
- Share data with advertising networks  
- Sell your data
- Transmit your data to our servers
- Use any third-party SDKs that collect data

The app is completely self-contained. Your data stays on your device.

## Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)

YouChoose is designed for use by parents and caregivers to help children, including children under 13, make choices. We take children's privacy extremely seriously.

**We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.** All data created in the app:
- Stays on the device
- Is controlled by the parent/caregiver
- Is never transmitted to us or any third party
- Can be deleted at any time by the parent/caregiver

Parents and guardians maintain complete control over all content and can delete all data at any time through the app's settings.

## Your Rights and Controls

### Access
All your data is accessible within the app. You can view, edit, or delete any boards or choices at any time.

## Special Considerations for AAC Use

As an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) app, we recognize that communication is a fundamental human right. We have designed YouChoose with the following privacy principles specific to AAC users:

### Communication Privacy
- We never log or record what is communicated using the app
- Speech output uses iOS text-to-speech and is not recorded
- No communication content is ever transmitted or stored beyond what you explicitly create in boards

### User Autonomy
- All settings and controls are designed to be accessible to caregivers
- Users can have privacy in their communication choices
- No data about specific communication events is shared with anyone

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. When we make changes:
- We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Significant changes will be announced in the app's update notes
- Your continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the updated policy

You can always view the current Privacy Policy in the app under Settings → More → Privacy Policy.

## Data Retention

### User-Created Content
Your choice boards and choices are kept until you delete them. They will remain on your device as long as the app is installed.

### Analytics Data
If enabled, analytics data is automatically deleted based on your retention setting:
- Default: 30 days
- Options: 7, 30, or 90 days
- You can manually delete all analytics data at any time

### App Deletion
When you delete YouChoose, all data is removed from your device, including:

**Important:** Deleting the app permanently removes all data. We cannot recover it because we never had access to it.

## Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for processing your information is:
- **Legitimate Interest:** To provide and improve the app's functionality
- **Consent:** For optional analytics features (which you can enable/disable at any time)

Since all data stays on your device, most GDPR requirements do not apply, but we follow GDPR principles as a matter of best practice.

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

California residents have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):

- **Right to Know:** You can access all your data within the app
- **Right to Delete:** You can delete all your data at any time
- **Right to Opt-Out:** Not applicable - we do not sell personal information
- **Non-Discrimination:** Not applicable - all features are free

Since we do not collect or transmit personal information off your device, many CCPA provisions do not apply, but we respect these rights as a privacy best practice.

## State-Specific Privacy Rights

Residents of states with comprehensive privacy laws (Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, etc.) have rights including:
- Access to data
- Correction of data  
- Deletion of data
- Opt-out of data sales (not applicable - we don't sell data)

All these rights are fully supported through the app's built-in controls, as all data remains on your device.

## International Users

YouChoose is available worldwide. All data storage and processing occurs locally on your device, regardless of your location. We do not transfer data internationally because we do not collect or transmit your data.

We are committed to making this privacy policy accessible to all users:
- Plain language is used throughout
- Available in the app for offline access
- Can be read by screen readers
