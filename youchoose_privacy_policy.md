YouChoose is designed with privacy at its core. This app was created to help parents offer quick, simple choices for their special needs children. We understand that communication is deeply personal, and we are committed to protecting your family's privacy.

**Our fundamental principle: Your data stays on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or sell any of your information.**

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

YouChoose stores the following information locally on your iPhone or iPad. This data never leaves your device:

#### 3. Quick Buttons
- Quick action button titles, colors, and symbols

#### 4. Usage Analytics (Always Active)
YouChoose automatically collects the following interaction data locally on your device to provide usage insights in the Stats tab:

### Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be clear about what we do not collect:
- We do not collect any personal information beyond what you enter into the app
- We do not collect the content of your communications
- We do not record what you or your child say using the app
- We do not track your location
- We do not use analytics services (like Google Analytics or Firebase)
- We do not use advertising networks
- We do not require accounts or login
- We do not transmit any data to our servers or cloud services

## How We Use Information

All information collected by YouChoose is used solely on your device to:
- Save your profiles, choice boards, and preferences
- Provide usage insights in the Stats tab (vocabulary growth, choice diversity, response times, activity patterns)
- Allow you to export analytics as PDF reports or CSV data for clinical or personal review
- Improve your experience with the app

**We never use your information for advertising, marketing, or any purpose beyond the core functionality of the app.**

## Photo Library Access

YouChoose requests permission to access your photo library only if you choose to add custom photos to profiles, choice buttons, or quick buttons.

**How we use photos:**
- Photos are stored locally on your device as part of your app data
- Photos are never uploaded to our servers or any cloud service
- You can remove photos from the app at any time
- If you delete a profile, its associated choice boards and photos are deleted from the app

**You can deny photo access** and still use all other features of YouChoose. The app will work fully with SF Symbols (icons) instead of photos.

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
All data is stored securely on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework and encrypted iOS storage. Your data is protected by your device's security features, including:
- Device passcode/Face ID/Touch ID
- iOS encryption
- Secure storage containers

### No Cloud Storage
YouChoose does not sync data to iCloud or any other cloud service. Your data exists only on your device. This means:
- Complete privacy - no data transmitted anywhere
- If you delete the app or reset your device, your data will be lost
- Backup your device regularly using iTunes or iCloud backup to preserve your data

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

**We do not share your data with anyone.** Period.

YouChoose does not:
- Share data with third-party analytics services
- Share data with advertising networks
- Sell your data
- Transmit your data to our servers
- Use any third-party SDKs that collect data

The app uses only Apple's built-in frameworks (SwiftUI, SwiftData, AVFoundation, Charts, PhotosUI). No third-party code is included. Your data stays on your device.

## Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)

YouChoose is designed for use by parents and caregivers to help children, including children under 13, make choices. We take children's privacy extremely seriously.

**We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.** All data created in the app:
- Stays on the device
- Is controlled by the parent/caregiver
- Is never transmitted to us or any third party
- Can be deleted at any time by the parent/caregiver

Parents and guardians maintain complete control over all content and can delete all data at any time by removing profiles, boards, or the app itself.

## Your Rights and Controls

You have complete control over your data:

### Access
All your data is accessible within the app. You can view, edit, or delete any profiles, boards, quick buttons, or choices at any time.

### Deletion
You can delete:
- Individual choices, quick buttons, or boards
- Entire profiles (which cascades to delete all associated boards, choices, and quick buttons)
- All app data by deleting the app

### Export
You can export your analytics data from the Stats tab:
- **PDF Report:** A formatted summary of usage statistics for a selected profile and time range
- **CSV Data:** Raw interaction data including timestamps, event types, board names, choice titles, response times, and session IDs

Exported files are generated locally and shared using the standard iOS share sheet. They are not transmitted to us.

## Special Considerations for AAC Use

As an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) app, we recognize that communication is a fundamental human right. We have designed YouChoose with the following privacy principles specific to AAC users:

### Communication Privacy
- We never log or record what is communicated using the app beyond the interaction events stored locally for your review
- Speech output uses iOS text-to-speech and is not recorded
- No communication content is ever transmitted or stored beyond what you explicitly create in boards

### User Autonomy
- All settings and controls are designed to be accessible to caregivers
- Users can have privacy in their communication choices
- No data about specific communication events is shared with anyone outside the device

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. When we make changes:
- We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Significant changes will be announced in the app's update notes
- Your continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the updated policy

## Data Retention

### User-Created Content
Your profiles, choice boards, quick buttons, and choices are kept until you delete them. They will remain on your device as long as the app is installed.

### Analytics Data
Interaction event data is retained on your device indefinitely while the app is installed. You can export this data at any time via the Stats tab. All analytics data is deleted when the app is uninstalled.

### App Deletion
When you delete YouChoose, all data is removed from your device, including:
- All profiles and their associated boards, choices, and quick buttons
- All photos added to the app
- All interaction event (analytics) data
- All settings and preferences

**Important:** Deleting the app permanently removes all data. We cannot recover it because we never had access to it.

## Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for processing your information is:
- **Legitimate Interest:** To provide and improve the app's functionality

Since all data stays on your device and is never transmitted to us, most GDPR requirements regarding data controllers do not apply. However, we follow GDPR principles as a matter of best practice.

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

California residents have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):

- **Right to Know:** You can access all your data within the app
- **Right to Delete:** You can delete all your data at any time
- **Right to Opt-Out:** Not applicable - we do not sell personal information
- **Non-Discrimination:** Not applicable - all features are free

Since we do not collect or transmit personal information off your device, many CCPA provisions do not apply, but we respect these rights as a privacy best practice.

## State-Specific Privacy Rights

Residents of states with comprehensive privacy laws (Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, etc.) have rights including:
- Access to data
- Correction of data
- Deletion of data
- Opt-out of data sales (not applicable - we don't sell data)

All these rights are fully supported through the app's built-in controls, as all data remains on your device.

## International Users

YouChoose is available worldwide. All data storage and processing occurs locally on your device, regardless of your location. We do not transfer data internationally because we do not collect or transmit your data.

## Accessibility of This Policy

We are committed to making this privacy policy accessible to all users:
- Plain language is used throughout
- Can be read by screen readers
- Available online for reference at any time

For users with cognitive disabilities or those who need simplified explanations, here is a summary:
