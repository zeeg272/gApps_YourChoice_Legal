# Privacy Policy for YourChoice

**Effective Date:** October 14, 2025
**Last Updated:** February 8, 2026

## Our Privacy Commitment

YourChoice is designed with privacy at its core. This app was created to help parents offer quick, simple choices for their special needs children. We understand that communication is deeply personal, and we are committed to protecting your family's privacy.

**Our fundamental principle: Your data stays on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or sell any of your information.**

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

YourChoice stores the following information locally on your iPhone or iPad. This data never leaves your device:

#### 1. Profiles
- Profile names you create (e.g., a child's first name)
- Colors and symbols you select for each profile
- Optional photos you add to profiles (from your photo library), which may be cropped using the built-in image cropper
- Per-profile settings (speech rate, display preferences, board layout)

#### 2. Choice Boards and Choices
- Board names you create
- Choice text and titles
- Colors you select for choices
- SF Symbols (icons) you choose
- Photos, animated GIFs, and short video clips you add to choices (from your photo library)
- Optional custom audio recordings you attach to choices (recorded via microphone)
- Organization and order of your boards
- Folder assignments for board organization

#### 3. Quick Buttons
- Quick action button titles, colors, and symbols
- Optional photos, GIFs, or video clips you add to quick buttons
- Optional custom audio recordings you attach to quick buttons
- Usage timestamps

#### 4. Usage Analytics (Always Active)
YourChoice automatically collects the following interaction data locally on your device to provide usage insights in the Stats tab:
- Which boards you use most frequently
- How many times choices are selected
- Response times (how quickly choices are made)
- When and how long the app is used (session data)
- Board and choice names associated with each interaction
- Quick button usage
- Tap miss events (when taps land outside a choice button)

**Important: All analytics data:**
- Stays on your device only
- Can be exported by you as PDF or CSV for clinical or personal use
- Can be cleared at any time using the "Clear All Data" option in the Stats tab or when deleting a board
- Is never transmitted to us or any third party
- Contains no personal content beyond the board and choice names you create

#### 5. App Preferences
- Settings you configure (speech rate, audio in silent mode)
- Display preferences (show/hide UI elements, last choice indicators, tap miss feedback)
- Board layout and sort order preferences
- Active profile selection
- Onboarding completion status

### Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be clear about what we do not collect:
- We do not collect any personal information beyond what you enter into the app
- We do not collect the content of your communications
- We do not record what you or your child say using the app
- We do not track your location
- We do not use analytics services (like Google Analytics or Firebase)
- We do not use advertising networks
- We do not require accounts or login
- We do not transmit any data to our servers or cloud services

## How We Use Information

All information collected by YourChoice is used solely on your device to:
- Save your profiles, choice boards, and preferences
- Provide usage insights in the Stats tab (vocabulary growth, choice diversity, response times, activity patterns)
- Allow you to export analytics as PDF reports or CSV data for clinical or personal review
- Allow you to share boards with other YourChoice users via `.yourchoice` files
- Improve your experience with the app

**We never use your information for advertising, marketing, or any purpose beyond the core functionality of the app.**

## Photo Library Access

YourChoice requests permission to access your photo library only if you choose to add custom photos, animated GIFs, or video clips to profiles, choice buttons, or quick buttons.

**How we use photos and media:**
- Photos, GIFs, and videos are stored locally on your device as part of your app data
- Profile photos may be cropped using the built-in image cropper before saving
- Video clips are limited to 30 seconds and compressed for efficient storage
- Thumbnails are generated locally for video and GIF previews
- Media is never uploaded to our servers or any cloud service
- You can remove media from the app at any time
- If you delete a profile, its associated choice boards and media are deleted from the app

**You can deny photo access** and still use all other features of YourChoice. The app will work fully with SF Symbols (icons) instead of photos.

## Microphone Access

YourChoice requests permission to access your device's microphone only if you choose to record custom audio for choice buttons or quick buttons (Pro feature).

**How we use audio recordings:**
- Audio is recorded locally on your device (up to 10 seconds per recording)
- Recordings are stored as part of your app data in AAC audio format
- Audio is never uploaded to our servers or any cloud service
- You can remove or re-record audio at any time
- Audio recordings are deleted when their associated choice or quick button is deleted

**You can deny microphone access** and still use all other features of YourChoice, including the built-in text-to-speech.

## Guided Access Detection

YourChoice detects whether iOS Guided Access is active on your device. This is used solely to simplify the interface automatically — hiding editing controls and navigation options so the child interacts only with choice buttons. No data about Guided Access usage is stored, collected, or transmitted.

## Board Sharing and Import

YourChoice allows you to share and import choice boards as `.yourchoice` files:

**Exporting boards:**
- Board data (names, choices, media) is packaged into a local file
- Files are shared using the standard iOS share sheet (AirDrop, Messages, Mail, etc.)
- We do not have access to shared files — sharing occurs directly between devices

**Importing boards:**
- Imported boards are stored locally on your device like any other board
- Non-Pro users will have video/GIF media converted to static images and custom audio removed during import

## In-App Purchases

YourChoice offers a one-time Pro upgrade ($1.99, family shareable) through Apple's App Store. Purchase transactions are processed entirely by Apple using StoreKit. We do not collect, store, or have access to any payment information, credit card details, or Apple ID data. The app only receives a confirmation from Apple that the purchase was completed.

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
All data is stored securely on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework and encrypted iOS storage. Your data is protected by your device's security features, including:
- Device passcode/Face ID/Touch ID
- iOS encryption
- Secure storage containers

### No Cloud Storage
YourChoice does not sync data to iCloud or any other cloud service. Your data exists only on your device. This means:
- Complete privacy - no data transmitted anywhere
- If you delete the app or reset your device, your data will be lost
- Backup your device regularly using iTunes or iCloud backup to preserve your data

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

**We do not share your data with anyone.** Period.

YourChoice does not:
- Share data with third-party analytics services
- Share data with advertising networks
- Sell your data
- Transmit your data to our servers
- Use any third-party SDKs that collect data

The app uses only Apple's built-in frameworks (SwiftUI, SwiftData, AVFoundation, StoreKit, Charts, PhotosUI). No third-party code is included. Your data stays on your device.

## Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)

YourChoice is designed for use by parents and caregivers to help children, including children under 13, make choices. We take children's privacy extremely seriously.

**We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.** All data created in the app:
- Stays on the device
- Is controlled by the parent/caregiver
- Is never transmitted to us or any third party
- Can be deleted at any time by the parent/caregiver

Parents and guardians maintain complete control over all content and can delete all data at any time by removing profiles, boards, or the app itself.

## Your Rights and Controls

You have complete control over your data:

### Access
All your data is accessible within the app. You can view, edit, or delete any profiles, boards, quick buttons, or choices at any time.

### Deletion
You can delete:
- Individual choices, quick buttons, or boards
- A board along with all its associated analytics data (two-step deletion)
- All analytics data for a profile using the "Clear All Data" option in the Stats tab
- Entire profiles (which cascades to delete all associated boards, choices, and quick buttons)
- All app data by deleting the app

### Export
You can export your data from the app:
- **PDF Report:** A formatted summary of usage statistics for a selected profile and time range
- **CSV Data:** Raw interaction data including timestamps, event types, board names, choice titles, response times, and session IDs
- **Board Files:** Choice boards exported as `.yourchoice` files containing all board data and media

Exported files are generated locally and shared using the standard iOS share sheet. They are not transmitted to us.

## Special Considerations for AAC Use

As an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) app, we recognize that communication is a fundamental human right. We have designed YourChoice with the following privacy principles specific to AAC users:

### Communication Privacy
- We never log or record what is communicated using the app beyond the interaction events stored locally for your review
- Speech output uses iOS text-to-speech and is not recorded
- Custom audio recordings are created and controlled entirely by the caregiver
- No communication content is ever transmitted or stored beyond what you explicitly create in boards

### User Autonomy
- All settings and controls are designed to be accessible to caregivers
- Guided Access integration allows caregivers to lock the interface to choice-only mode
- Users can have privacy in their communication choices
- No data about specific communication events is shared with anyone outside the device

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. When we make changes:
- We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Significant changes will be announced in the app's update notes
- Your continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the updated policy

## Data Retention

### User-Created Content
Your profiles, choice boards, quick buttons, and choices are kept until you delete them. They will remain on your device as long as the app is installed.

### Analytics Data
Interaction event data is retained on your device while the app is installed. You can export this data at any time via the Stats tab, or clear it using the "Clear All Data" option. Analytics data associated with a specific board can also be removed when deleting that board. All analytics data is deleted when the app is uninstalled.

### App Deletion
When you delete YourChoice, all data is removed from your device, including:
- All profiles and their associated boards, choices, and quick buttons
- All photos, videos, GIFs, and audio recordings added to the app
- All interaction event (analytics) data
- All settings and preferences
- All board folders and organization

**Important:** Deleting the app permanently removes all data. We cannot recover it because we never had access to it.

## Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for processing your information is:
- **Legitimate Interest:** To provide and improve the app's functionality

Since all data stays on your device and is never transmitted to us, most GDPR requirements regarding data controllers do not apply. However, we follow GDPR principles as a matter of best practice.

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

California residents have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):

- **Right to Know:** You can access all your data within the app
- **Right to Delete:** You can delete all your data at any time
- **Right to Opt-Out:** Not applicable - we do not sell personal information
- **Non-Discrimination:** We do not discriminate based on exercising privacy rights. A free tier and a one-time Pro upgrade are available to all users

Since we do not collect or transmit personal information off your device, many CCPA provisions do not apply, but we respect these rights as a privacy best practice.

## State-Specific Privacy Rights

Residents of states with comprehensive privacy laws (Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, etc.) have rights including:
- Access to data
- Correction of data
- Deletion of data
- Opt-out of data sales (not applicable - we don't sell data)

All these rights are fully supported through the app's built-in controls, as all data remains on your device.

## International Users

YourChoice is available worldwide. All data storage and processing occurs locally on your device, regardless of your location. We do not transfer data internationally because we do not collect or transmit your data.

## Accessibility of This Policy

We are committed to making this privacy policy accessible to all users:
- Plain language is used throughout
- Can be read by screen readers
- Available online for reference at any time

For users with cognitive disabilities or those who need simplified explanations, here is a summary:

### Simple Summary

- We never send your information anywhere
- You control everything and can delete anything
- Photos, videos, and audio you add stay on your device
- Usage statistics stay on your device (you can export or clear them if you want)
